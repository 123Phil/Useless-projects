The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.
Devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing "social physics", it is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height â€“ with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)

Basal metabolic rate (BMR), and the closely related resting metabolic rate (RMR), is the rate of energy expenditure by humans and other animals at rest, and is measured in kJ per hour per kg body mass. Rest is defined as existing in a neutrally temperate environment while in the post-absorptive state.
The release, and using, of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs: the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, brain and skin.
