Review for v1.1

Probably doesn't need a fix
Prompt for resetting the data pops up after inputting an invalid value. Same for reversed start-end dates. It will still function correctly if you just enter 'y'. 
	What days does the class meet?
	Enter days as "sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat"
	  ex:  mon,wed
	m
	Error reading weekdays, try again.
	Entering new course details will reset attendance information
	  Continue: (y/n)
	  
Didn't find anything else wrong that wasn't mention


-Updated so that it does not ask to continue, but it does prompt for dates again
